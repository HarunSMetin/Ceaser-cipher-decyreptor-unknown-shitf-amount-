Your program should take 3 arguments. <br />
'-r' : contains the name of the reference text document. <br />
'-c' : contains the name of the encrypted text document.  <br />
'-p' : specifies the name of the document in which the decrypted text will be written.
 <br /> <br />
Text documents contain only English characters and can be of variable length. The reference text document contains very long unencrypted text written in English. Using this reference text document, the code learns how to decode the encrypted text by analyzing which letter is used and how often. <br /> <br />

The ciphertext document contains a Caesar cipher-encrypted text and the amount of bias is unknown.
